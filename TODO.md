Here's a TODO list for improving the voice cloner model:

# Voice Cloner Improvements TODO 12/5

## Audio Processing Enhancements
- [ ] Implement Variable Time Stretching
  - Add dynamic tempo adjustments based on sentence context
  - Use `librosa.effects.time_stretch()` with contextual factors
  - Consider emotional context for tempo variations

- [ ] Enhanced Prosody Control
  - [ ] Implement SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) support
  - [ ] Add emotion-based prosody markers
  - [ ] Develop better pause duration logic based on punctuation
  - [ ] Implement intonation patterns for questions vs. statements

## Model Improvements
- [ ] Speaker Embedding Enhancement
  - [ ] Add more augmentation techniques (noise, reverb, pitch variations)
  - [ ] Implement contrastive learning for better voice similarity
  - [ ] Create a voice consistency checker

- [ ] Advanced Voice Quality
  - [ ] Implement formant preservation during pitch shifting
  - [ ] Add voice age detection and adaptation
  - [ ] Develop breathing sound insertion at natural points

## Natural Speech Elements
- [ ] Add Human-like Imperfections
