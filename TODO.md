# Voice Cloner Priority Improvements TODO

## 1. Research & Understanding Current Architecture
- High priority
- Understanding the current architecture (crucial for meaningful improvements)
- [x] Deep dive into XTTS v2 architecture and components
  - [x] Study the model's encoder-decoder structure
  - [x] Understand the speaker conditioning mechanism
  - [x] Research how the emotion embeddings are implemented
  - [x] Document key innovations from YourTTS/Coqui

## 2. Enhanced Prosody Control
- Medium priority
- Prosody control (key for natural-sounding speech)
- [x] Implement SSML support for fine-grained control
  - [x] Add emotion-based prosody markers
  - [x] Develop better pause duration logic
  - [x] Implement intonation patterns for questions vs statements
  - [x] Study how XTTS handles prosody internally

## 3. Speaker Embedding Enhancement
- Medium priority
- Speaker embedding (core to voice cloning quality)
- [x] Improve voice similarity and consistency
  - [x] Add strategic augmentation (noise, reverb, pitch variations)
  - [x] Implement contrastive learning techniques
  - [x] Create voice consistency validation tools
  - [x] Study XTTS's current speaker embedding approach

## 4. Testing & Quality Framework
- High priority
- Testing framework (essential for validating improvements)
- [ ] Build comprehensive testing pipeline
  - Create automated quality metrics
  - Implement A/B testing framework
  - Add perceptual quality tests
  - Set up systematic voice comparison tools

## 5. Natural Speech Elements
- Low priority
- Natural speech elements (for better overall quality)
- [ ] Add context-aware speech improvements
  - Implement dynamic tempo adjustments
  - Add natural pauses and breathing
  - Include micro-variations in pitch
  - Study how XTTS handles natural speech elements
